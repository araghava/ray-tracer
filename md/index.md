Ray Tracing in C++
==================

Implementation of a ray tracer in C++ for [CS 6620](http://www.cemyuksel.com/courses/utah/cs6620/) at the [University of Utah](http://www.utah.edu/), Fall 2013.

At different phases of this code, the ray tracer was tested on a scene, and each project page highlights the progression of the ray tracer throughout the course:

  - [Project 1](prj1.html)

  - [Project 3](prj3.html)
  - [Project 4](prj4.html)
  - [Project 5](prj5.html)
  - [Project 6](prj6.html)
  - [Project 7](prj7.html)
  - [Project 8](prj8.html)
  - [Project 9](prj9.html)
  - [Project 10](prj10.html)
