Project 2 - Shading
===================

Now, the ray tracer can detect both lighting in the scene and materials that get tied to objects. With materials on the objects, camera rays can be tracked back to the light sources in order to detect the appropriate shading of each pixel. For shading based on these materials, both the Phong and Blinn-Phong shading models have been implemented.
