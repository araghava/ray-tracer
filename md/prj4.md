Project 4 - Reflections & Refractions
=====================================

Now, the ray tracer can follow camera rays as they bounce off and through our different scene objects, with simple reflections and refractions. This includes both total internal reflections along with [a Schlick approximation of the Fresnel equations](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs148-10-summer/docs/2006--degreve--reflection_refraction.pdf). Additionally, rays are shaded as they move through objects, due to volumetric absorption. Lastly, it is important to note that these effects have only been calculated for camera rays, not for light rays.
