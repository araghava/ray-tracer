Project 1 - Ray Casting
=======================

This project provides the barebones structure and fundamental functions that the rest of the course and the ray tracer builds upon. It simply casts light rays in a scene to detect where objects are visible by the camera. It outputs a simple PPM image file based on a given XML file input of a scene.
