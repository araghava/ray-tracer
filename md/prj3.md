Project 3 - Shadows
===================

In theory, a simple addition of code should produce ray-traced shadows in our scene. For some reason, this functionality is putting my entire scene in shadow. Ignoring the shadow, the shading is right, and I have quadruple-checked the shadow rays being generated. I am completely stumped.
